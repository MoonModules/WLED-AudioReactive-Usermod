# AGENTS.md — Build Verification Guide

This document explains how an automated agent (or a developer) can compile-test
the OO library against a real WLED firmware build to verify that it integrates
correctly as a drop-in replacement for the monolithic `audioreactive` usermod.

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| [PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/index.html) | `pip install platformio` or the VSCode extension |
| WLED checkout | See "Choosing a WLED fork" below |

### Choosing a WLED fork

The required fork for testing this out-of-tree usermod is:

| Fork | Branch | Defines |
|---|---|---|
| [`netmindz/WLED-MM`](https://github.com/netmindz/WLED-MM) | `AR-Usermod-out-of-tree` | `_MoonModules_WLED_`, `WLEDMM_FASTPATH`, etc. |

This branch contains the necessary changes to support loading the audioreactive
usermod as an out-of-tree library.

Use a **fresh, clean clone** for build testing — do not reuse a checkout that
has local modifications or a `platformio_override.ini` from another project:

```sh
git clone --depth=1 -b AR-Usermod-out-of-tree https://github.com/netmindz/WLED-MM.git /tmp/WLED-MM
```

## How WLED loads usermods

WLED's `pio-scripts/load_usermods.py` processes the `custom_usermods` key from
`platformio.ini`. A bare name like `audioreactive` is resolved to
`usermods/<name>/` inside the WLED tree. An external path (e.g.
`symlink:///abs/path`) is passed directly to `lib_deps`.

A library is recognised as a *WLED module* (and gets WLED's `src/` prepended to
its include path, which is required for `wled.h` to resolve) when any of these
is true:

- the library source lives under `WLED/usermods/`
- `library.json` `"name"` starts with `"wled-"` ← **our library qualifies**
- the dep name was listed explicitly in `custom_usermods` as an external entry

Because our `library.json` name is `wled-audioreactive`, the script recognises
it automatically without any special configuration.

---

## Method A — `platformio_override.ini` (recommended, non-destructive)

WLED reads `platformio_override.ini` if it exists and merges it with
`platformio.ini`. This file is already in WLED's `.gitignore`, so it is safe to
create locally without affecting the WLED tree.

Create `<WLED-checkout>/platformio_override.ini` with the following content
(replace the path with the absolute path to this repo):

```ini
[env:esp32dev_oo]
extends = env:esp32dev
custom_usermods = symlink:///absolute/path/to/WLED-AudioReactive-Usermod
```

> **Why override `custom_usermods`?**
> PlatformIO `extends` semantics: a child env's `custom_usermods` **replaces**
> the parent's value entirely. Setting it to the OO symlink path means only
> this library is loaded — the monolithic `usermods/audioreactive/` is not
> linked, avoiding a name/symbol collision.

Build the new env:

```sh
cd /path/to/WLED-checkout
pio run -e esp32dev_oo
```

A successful build (zero errors) confirms the OO library is a valid drop-in.

---

## Method B — Symlink replacement (modifies the WLED tree)

Replace the monolithic usermod folder with a symlink to this repo:

```sh
cd /path/to/WLED-checkout
rm -rf usermods/audioreactive
ln -s /absolute/path/to/WLED-AudioReactive-Usermod usermods/audioreactive
```

Then build any env that uses `custom_usermods = audioreactive`:

```sh
pio run -e esp32dev
```

Restore afterwards:

```sh
rm usermods/audioreactive
git checkout -- usermods/audioreactive
```

---

## Known pre-existing issues to ignore

The `examples/` directory in *this* repo contains a standalone `platformio.ini`
for the OO library in isolation. It has a **pre-existing** build error that
exists on the unmodified branch and is unrelated to the OO refactor:

1. `audio_source.h` incomplete types — this header depends on WLED internals
   (`WS2812FX`, `Segment`, `PinManager`, etc.) that are not present in the
   examples build.

This error appears when running `pio run` inside `examples/`. It does **not**
appear in a full WLED build and should be ignored during integration testing.

## Quick-reference commands

```sh
# Clone a clean WLED-MM checkout on the correct branch (do not reuse an existing one)
git clone --depth=1 -b AR-Usermod-out-of-tree https://github.com/netmindz/WLED-MM.git /tmp/WLED-MM

# Create the override file (replace the path with the absolute path to this repo)
cat > /tmp/WLED-MM/platformio_override.ini <<'EOF'
[env:esp32dev_oo]
extends = env:esp32dev
custom_usermods = symlink:///absolute/path/to/WLED-AudioReactive-Usermod
EOF

# Build (zero errors = valid drop-in)
cd /tmp/WLED-MM
pio run -e esp32dev_oo 2>&1 | tail -30

# Diff the OO library against the original MoonModules main (for parity checks)
diff /tmp/main_audio_reactive.h \
     /path/to/WLED-AudioReactive-Usermod/audio_reactive.h | less
```
